# Data structures and algorithms practice
Some practice problems I've completed in the past, topics practiced include:
### - Graphs
### - BFS/DFS
### - Stacks
### - Queues
### - Weighted Nodes
### - Shortest path
### - Game theory
### - Arrays
### - Trees
### - Dynamic programming

Each problem is commented with the problem statement, and the general approach I took to write a solution.
